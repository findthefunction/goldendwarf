Machine Learning and Cryptocurrency

## Selected Topic 
- Cryptocurrency trading bot and prediction dashboard
    - building a trading bot that pulls multiple forms of data (time series analysis, sentiment analysis, etc) to determine buy/sell signals. 

## Reason Why 
- Applying neural network fundamentals & data analytics knowledge to create a real-time automated machine that generates alpha through trading cryptocurrency.

## Data Source 
- Yahoo finance real-time market data (yfinance)
- Twitter (coin sentiment analysis) 
- Cryptowatch API

## Questions we hope to answer 
- Whether our created machine learning model is viable in accurately predicting cryptocurrency price movements more than 50% of the time (better than flipping a coin). 
- Can this model be successful in feeding information to a well-operating trading bot.
