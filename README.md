Machine Learning & Cryptocurrency

## Selected Topic 
- Cryptocurrency trading bot and prediction dashboard.
- Building a trading bot that pulls multiple forms of data (time series analysis, sentiment analysis, etc) to determine buy/sell signals. 

## Crypto Coins 
- Bitcoin (BTC)
- Etherium (ETH)
- Cardano (ADA)

## Reason Why 
- Applying neural network fundamentals & data analytics knowledge, to create a real-time automated machine that generates alpha through trading cryptocurrency.
- Implementation of Java and HTML design knowledge, to create an interactive and effecient dashborad interface for trading cryptocurrency.

## Data Source 
- Yahoo finance real-time market data (Yfinance)
- Twitter (coin sentiment analysis)
- Reddit  
- Cryptowatch API

## Data storage and software deployment
- MongoDB
- Flask
- Kubernetes
- Docker

## Questions we hope to answer 
- Whether our created machine learning model is viable, in accurately predicting cryptocurrency price movements more than 50% of the time (better than flipping a coin). 
- Can this model be successful in feeding information to a well-operating trading bot.

## Communication Protocols
-   Github projects, for tasks to be completed and who is assigned to complete.
-   Discord - Library server for communications
-  Make sure and use appropriate channels for discussion.
