Machine Learning & Cryptocurrency

## Selected Topic 
- Cryptocurrency trading bot and prediction dashboard.
- Building a trading bot that pulls multiple forms of data to determine buy/sell signals (time series analysis, sentiment analysis, etc). 

## Crypto Coins 
- Bitcoin (BTC)
- Etherium (ETH)
- Cardano (ADA)

## Reason Why 
- Applying neural network fundamentals & data analytics knowledge to create a real-time automated machine that generates alpha through trading cryptocurrency.
- Implementation of Java and HTML design knowledge to create an interactive and effecient dashborad interface for trading cryptocurrency.
- Automate the analysis and interpretation of market statistics.
- Calculate potential market risk and execute buying/selling cryptocurrency assets.

## Data Source 
- Yahoo finance real-time market data (yfinance)
- Twitter (coin sentiment analysis)
- Reddit  
- Cryptowatch API

## Data storage and software deployment
- MongoDB
- Flask
- Kubernetes
- Docker

## Questions we hope to answer 
- Whether our created machine learning model is viable in accurately predicting cryptocurrency price movements more than 50% of the time (i.e more reliable than flipping a coin).
- Can this model be successful in feeding information to a well-operating trading bot?

## Communication Protocols
-   Github projects - for identifying tasks and assigning group members to complete tasks.
-   Discord - Library server for communications
    -   Well categorized channels to organize discussion
-   Slack class channel
-   
## Presentation Format
